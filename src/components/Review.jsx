                    review="I visited The Majlis with friends, 
        and it was an unforgettable experience. 
        The lamb kebabs were perfectly cooked, 
        and the hummus was the best I've ever had! 
        The restaurant has a cozy yet elegant vibe, 
        and the service was top-notch. Highly recommend 
        this place for anyone who loves great food and 
        hospitality."

        to the beautifully designed space, everything about The Majlis
        was perfect. I loved their baklavaâ€”it was the ideal way to end 
        the meal. The staff went above and beyond to make sure we had a 
        great time. Definitely my new go-to spot for dining out!"/>
